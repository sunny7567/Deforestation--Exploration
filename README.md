# Deforestation--Exploration
In this project, I do research in 3 different parts based on the data provided. 
1. Global Situation ( first I create the view that helps navigate data, I find the total forest area, and total land area each country has and I compare them with 26 years during how they grow in the world)
2. Regional Outlook ( I check the current percentage area and past forest area percentage and make a table for the top region)
3. Country-Level Detail ( I look for the top 5 country that has the highest growth in forest and forest percent devied on Quartile group)

In this all the different parts, they provided questions and I find answers using SQL postgre.
